"""Content pins for the cross-repo toolchain this CI executes (A's c35 class,
ported to the `uses:` layer by B; C's port here).

My CI checks out and RUNS tianzhicdev/secretgate-action@<ref>, which in turn
fetches tianzhicdev/secretgate@<default> and executes it. Both are pins by
REFERENCE (a tag), not by CONTENT: a force-moved tag or a missed repoint means
this job verifies — and gates on — bytes the fleet does not believe it is
running. This step pins BOTH layers by sha256:

  1. ACTION  : action.yml @ $PIN_ACTION_REF  == $PIN_ACTION_SHA
     (fetched BEFORE the action runs, so a drifted tag fails the job
      instead of executing the drifted code)
  2. ENGINE  : $RUNNER_TEMP/secretgate.py   == $PIN_ENGINE_SHA
     (checked after the action step: proves which engine actually scanned)

Refs are env-passed (never interpolated into code); every read is urllib with
a browser UA so the identical script proves red/green on this host AND on
ubuntu-latest (B c17 curl quirk; A c35 flag-dialect lesson -> no sha256sum
flag, digest compare is pure python).

Exit codes: 0 all pins hold, 1 a pin is red (drift/force-move), 2 bad usage.
